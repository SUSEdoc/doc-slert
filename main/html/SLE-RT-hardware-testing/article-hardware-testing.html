    Using SUSE® Linux Enterprise Real Time needs real-time capable hardware. This paper
    describes the tools that can be used to determine if a specific hardware
    has the needed real-time capabilities. Specifically, it describes
    <code class="systemitem">cyclictest</code> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hardware latency
    detector</span>”</span> and the ways to analyze their results.
   </p><p>
    Both the <code class="systemitem">cyclictest</code> and the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hardware

   The first task you need to do when evaluating hardware for real-time is
   described in the following procedure:
  </p><div class="procedure"><div class="procedure-contents"><ol class="procedure" type="1"><li class="step"><p>
     Determine the largest allowable latency of the system using the hardware
     latency detector:
    </p><ol type="a" class="substeps"><li class="step"><p>
       Set the machine for real-time performance.
      </p><p>
       Some servers have special settings for real-time, but they are strictly
       vendor specific.
      </p></li><li class="step"><p>
       Set everything to lowest possible latency.
      </p></li><li class="step"><p>
       Turn memory scrubbing down to as little as possible.
      </p></li><li class="step"><p>
       Use the hardware latency detector (see
       <a class="xref" href="article-hardware-testing.html#sec-hwtest-hwlat" title="3. Determining latencies with the hardware latency detector">Section 3, “Determining latencies with the hardware latency detector”</a> for details).
      </p></li></ol></li><li class="step"><p>
     Check the latencies measured by the hardware latency detector.
    </p><p>
     The latencies should be low enough to support your real-time application
     with enough of a margin to meet its deadlines. If it is not the case, even
     after tweaking the machine setting for better real-time performance, the
     hardware is not good enough for your application. Use a different
     hardware.
    </p></li><li class="step"><p>
     Measure latencies using <code class="command">cyclictest</code> (see
     <a class="xref" href="article-hardware-testing.html#sec-hwtest-cyct" title="2. Determining latencies with cyclictest">Section 2, “Determining latencies with <code class="command">cyclictest</code>”</a> for details).
    </p><p>
     In a typical situation 
     the latencies measured with <code class="command">cyclictest</code> should be mostly
     the same from those measured by the hardware latency detector. Latencies
     measured by <code class="command">cyclictest</code> include the latencies caused by
     the operating system and are thus closer to latencies measured in a real
     computing situation.
    </p></li></ol></div></div><p>
   If you encounter a significant difference between latencies measured by both
   methods there might be a software bug involved. Such latencies are a
   significant part caused by the operating system, not the hardware. In such a
   case, contact SUSE for support.
  </p></section><section class="sect1" id="sec-hwtest-cyct" data-id-title="Determining latencies with cyclictest"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">2 </span><span class="title-name">Determining latencies with <code class="command">cyclictest</code></span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#sec-hwtest-cyct">#</a></h2><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-slert/edit/main/xml/article_hardware_testing.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
   The <code class="command">cyclictest</code> command is part of the real-time kernel
   test suite contained in the <span class="package">rt-tests</span> RPM package. This
   package is distributed as part of SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time.
  </p><p>
   Make sure to be <code class="systemitem">root</code> or use <code class="command">sudo</code> to run
   <code class="command">cyclictest</code>.
  </p><p>
   When <code class="command">cyclictest</code> is running, it shows the number of cycles
   performed and the minimal, actual, average and maximum latency measured. To
   change the behaviour of <code class="command">cyclictest</code>, the following list
   gives you an overview of the available options:
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>
     The values shown are in microseconds. To use nanoseconds instead of
     microseconds, use the 
     <code class="option">--nsec</code> option.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     By default, <code class="command">cyclictest</code> runs forever. The number of
     cycles can be limited with the
     <code class="option">--loops=<em class="replaceable">NUMBER_OF_CYCLES</em></code>
     option.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     By default, only one thread is run. You can use the 
     <code class="option">--threads=<em class="replaceable">NUMBER_OF_THREADS</em></code>
     option to set the number of threads used. Without specifying a number, all
     available processors are used. With the 
     <code class="option">--affinity</code> option, the threads are pinned to the
     processors with the same number.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
     To create a histogram with the  latency values, use the
     <code class="option">--histogram=<em class="replaceable">NUMBER_OF_MICROSECONDS</em></code>
     option, where <em class="replaceable">NUMBER_OF_MICROSECONDS</em> determines
     the maximum tracking time. Larger values are reported as histogram
     overflows. The histogram is written to standard out (STDOUT), but you can
     redirect it to a file:
    </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen"><code class="command">cyclictest</code> --loops=1000 \
--histogram=1000 &gt; histogram</pre></div></li></ul></div></section><section class="sect1" id="sec-hwtest-hwlat" data-id-title="Determining latencies with the hardware latency detector"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><div class="title-container"><h2 class="title"><span class="title-number-name"><span class="title-number">3 </span><span class="title-name">Determining latencies with the hardware latency detector</span></span> <a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#sec-hwtest-hwlat">#</a></h2><div class="icons"><a target="_blank" class="icon-reportbug" title="Report an issue"> </a><a target="_blank" class="icon-editsource" href="https://github.com/SUSE/doc-slert/edit/main/xml/article_hardware_testing.xml" title="Edit source document"> </a></div></div></div></div></div><p>
   The <span class="emphasis"><em>hardware latency detector</em></span>
   (<code class="command">hwlatdetect</code>) is a program that controls the kernel
   latency detector module (<code class="filename">hwlat_detector.ko</code>), installed
   with the real-time debug kernel (the <span class="package">kernel-rt_debug</span>
   package). This is a special kernel module that is used to detect large
   system latencies, caused by the behavior of the underlying hardware or
   firmware, independent of Linux itself (system management interrupts, SMIs).
  </p><p>
   The hardware latency detector module works by making all CPUs busy for
   configurable amounts of time. This is done by calling
   <code class="systemitem">stop_machine()</code>,
   polling the CPU Time Stamp Counter (TSC) for some period, and then looking
   for gaps in the TSC data. These gaps indicate times when the polling was
   disturbed by SMIs.
  </p><p>
   To start using hardware latency detector, use as
   <code class="systemitem">root</code>:
  </p><div class="verbatim-wrap"><pre class="screen">hwlatdetect --threshold=10</pre></div><p>
   The <code class="literal">threshold</code> value is the minimum latency value to be
   considered in microseconds. Use the value which is relevant for your
   particular situation.
  </p><p>
   <code class="command">hwlatdetect</code> has the following options:
  </p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.1"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--duration="<em class="replaceable">VALUE</em>"{s,m,h,d,w}</code></span></dt><dd><p>
      Run the detector logic for the specified duration.
      Provide the duration as a decimal integer value.
      The default duration unit for this value is seconds.
      To use a different unit, append <code class="literal">m</code> (minutes),
      <code class="literal">h</code> (hours), <code class="literal">d</code> (days), or
      <code class="literal">w</code> (weeks) to the value.
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.2"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--threshold="<em class="replaceable">VALUE</em>"{us,ms,s}</code></span></dt><dd><p>
      Specify the TSC gap used to detect an SMI. Any gap value greater than
      threshold value is considered to be the result of an SMI occurring.
      The default duration unit for this value is microseconds.
      To use a different unit, append <code class="literal">ms</code> (milliseconds) or
      <code class="literal">s</code> (seconds) to the value.
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.3"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--hardlimit="<em class="replaceable">VALUE</em>"{us,ms,s}</code></span></dt><dd><p>
      The test is considered to have failed if a value above the hard limit
      value occurs.
      The default duration unit for this value is microseconds.
      To use a different unit, append <code class="literal">ms</code> (milliseconds) or
      <code class="literal">s</code> (seconds) to the value.
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.4"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--window="<em class="replaceable">VALUE</em>"{us,ms,s}</code></span></dt><dd><p>
      Specify the size of the sample window.
      The default duration unit for this value is microseconds.
      To use a different unit, append <code class="literal">ms</code> (milliseconds) or
      <code class="literal">s</code> (seconds) to the value.
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.5"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--width="<em class="replaceable">VALUE</em>"{us,ms,s}</code></span></dt><dd><p>
      The amount of time within the sample window where the detector is
      actually sampling. Must be less than the <code class="literal">--window</code>
      value.
      The default duration unit for this value is microseconds.
      To use a different unit, append <code class="literal">ms</code> (milliseconds) or
      <code class="literal">s</code> (seconds) to the value.
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.6"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--report=<em class="replaceable">FILE_NAME</em></code></span></dt><dd><p>
      Specify the output file name of the detector report. The default behavior
      is to print to standard output.
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.7"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--debug</code></span></dt><dd><p>
      Turn on debug output
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.8"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--quiet</code></span></dt><dd><p>
      Turn off information output.
     </p></dd><dt id="id-1.4.3.5.8.9"><span class="term"><code class="literal">--watch</code></span></dt><dd><p>

  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.7">#</a></h5></div><p>
  This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
  contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
  distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
  world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
  under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any
  such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
  addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
  distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.
 </p><p>
  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
  and/or translated into another language.
 </p><p>
  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
  Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
  authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
  matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
  subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
  Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could
  be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related
  matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political
  position regarding them.
 </p><p>
  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
  that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not
  fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
  designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
  If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
  none.
 </p><p>
  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
  Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
  Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most
  5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
 </p><p>
  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
  represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
  public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
  generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
  programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
  is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
  variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in
  an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup,
  has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
  readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for
  any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
  "Opaque".
 </p><p>
  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
  without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
  using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
  PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
  image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
  formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
  SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
  available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
  some word processors for output purposes only.
 </p><p>
  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus
  such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this
  License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which
  do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
  most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of
  the body of the text.
 </p><p>
  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title
  either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
  translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific
  section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
  "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section
  when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled
  XYZ" according to this definition.
 </p><p>
  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
  states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
  Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
  but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
  these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
  meaning of this License.

    2. VERBATIM COPYING
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.18">#</a></h5></div><p>
  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
  notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
  Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
  conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
  measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
  copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
  exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
  must also follow the conditions in section 3.
 </p><p>
  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you
  may publicly display copies.
 </p><div class="sect4 bridgehead"><h5 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.3.8.21"><span class="name">
    3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.21">#</a></h5></div><p>
  If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
  printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
  Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
  copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
  Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
  cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
  publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
  with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
  other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
  the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
  these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.
 </p><p>
  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
  you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the
  actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.
 </p><p>
  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
  than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
  along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
  computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
  access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
  latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
  copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
  year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
  through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.
 </p><p>
  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
  them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

    4. MODIFICATIONS
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.26">#</a></h5></div><p>
  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
  conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
  Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
  filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
  modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
  addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
 </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>
    Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from
    that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
    if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
    You may use the same title as a previous version if the original
    publisher of that version gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
    together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document
    (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they
    release you from this requirement.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
    Version, as the publisher.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to
    the other copyright notices.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms
    of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
    required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to
    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher
    of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no
    section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the
    title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its
    Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated
    in the previous sentence.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
    access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
    locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
    These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network
    location for a work that was published at least four years before the
    Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
    to gives permission.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve
    the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance
    and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications
    given therein.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
    text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not
    considered part of the section titles.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be
    included in the Modified Version.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to
    conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
   </p></li></ol></div><p>
  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
  that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
  Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections
  as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant
  Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be
  distinct from any other section titles.
 </p><p>
  You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
  example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
  an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.
 </p><p>
  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
  and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
  by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the
  same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
  entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
  replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
  that added the old one.
 </p><p>
  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
  permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
  endorsement of any Modified Version.

    5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.33">#</a></h5></div><p>
  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions,
  provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections
  of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as
  Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that
  you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
 </p><p>
  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple
  identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there
  are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents,
  make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in
  parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section
  if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section
  titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
  combined work.
 </p><p>
  In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in
  the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History";
  likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any
  sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled
  "Endorsements".

    6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.37">#</a></h5></div><p>
  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
  the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
  verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
 </p><p>
  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
  it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
  License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other
  respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
 </p><div class="sect4 bridgehead"><h5 class="title legal" id="id-1.4.3.8.40"><span class="name">
    7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.40">#</a></h5></div><p>
  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
  independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
  distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
  from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
  compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
  Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
  other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
  the Document.
 </p><p>
  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
  of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire
  aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket
  the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
  if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on
  printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

    8. TRANSLATION
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.43">#</a></h5></div><p>
  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
  translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
  Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
  their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
  Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant
  Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the
  license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided
  that you also include the original English version of this License and the
  original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a
  disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
  License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
 </p><p>
  If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
  "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
  Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

    9. TERMINATION
  </span><a title="Permalink" class="permalink" href="article-hardware-testing.html#id-1.4.3.8.46">#</a></h5></div><p>
  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as
  expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,
  modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
  automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
  who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
  have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
  compliance.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU
  Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns. See
  <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
 </p><p>
  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
  the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License
  "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
  terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later
  version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software
  Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this
  License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
  Free Software Foundation.
